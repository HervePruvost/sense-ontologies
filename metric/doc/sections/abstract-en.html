<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Metrics model (MM) consists of a taxonomy of quantities, quantity kinds and key metrics e.g. KPI (Key Performance Indicator) or KRI (Key Risk Indicator) that are used for quantification, measurement and sensing in engineering domain. More Specifically, it complements further ontologies like QUDT or SSN/SOSA with very specific metrics for e.g. HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning), building automation, building design, energy management, etc. It contrasts to rather more abstract quantities from other vocabularies.</span>
