<span class="markdown">The Metrics Model (MM) is an ontology that describes different kinds of quantities and key values
    which are usually used by engineers, architects and technicians who are involved in a building life cycle, either in
    its design, its construction or its operation. The model covers quantities which can be measured, assessed, computed
    or controlled in design and operation activities. Since existing terminologies have limitations and rather focus on
    defining abstract types of quantities e.g. from physics, chemistry or engineering in general, the Metrics Model
    complements such ontologies (like e.g. QUDT, SSN/SOSA...) with very specific metrics like in HVAC engineering,
    building automation or building energy simulation (e.g. mm:HeatingEnergyConsumption, mm:HeatingCoilValvePosition,
    mm:SupplyAirTemperature, mm:IndoorAirTemperature, and so on). That way, it contrasts with and complement more
    fundamental and higher-level concepts from other ontologies. The purpose of the Metrics Model is to support semantic
    applications related to performance assessment, energy audits, technical monitoring or optimized control of building
    assets.</span>
